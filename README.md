# Creating a Musician Web Site using ASP.NET MVC CodeFirst Entity Framework

Typescript Getting Started with [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) MVC

Are you ready to explore Typescript with [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) MVC? This powerful combination can help you create responsive, interactive, and scalable web applications with ease. In this blog post, we'll take you through the steps to get started with Typescript and MVC, from installation to creating your first web application. Let's dive in!

Installation and Setup

To get started with Typescript, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Once you have that, you can install Typescript globally using the following command:

npm install -g typescript

Next, let's create a new [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) MVC project in Visual Studio. Once the project is created, let's add a Typescript file to our project. Right-click on the project in Solution Explorer and select Add > New Item. From the dialog box, select TypeScript File and name it "app.ts".

Writing Typescript Code

Now that we have a Typescript file, let's write some code. First, let's declare a variable and assign it a value:

var message: string = "Hello World";
console.log(message);

Next, let's create a class and use it in our code:

class Greeter {
greeting: string;
constructor(message: string) {
this.greeting = message;
}
greet() {
return "Hello, " + this.greeting;
}
}
let greeter = new Greeter("world");
console.log(greeter.greet());

Compiling and Running the Code

To compile the Typescript code, you can use the following command:

tsc app.ts

This will create a JavaScript file named "app.js" in the same directory as the Typescript file. You can run the code using Node.js by running the following command:

node app.js

Congratulations, you've just created your first Typescript program! Now let's take a look at how we can use Typescript in an [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) MVC application.

Creating an [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) MVC Application with Typescript

To create an [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) MVC application with Typescript, we'll use Visual Studio's built-in templates. Open Visual Studio and select File > New > Project. From the New Project dialog box, select [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) Web Application and name it "TypescriptMVC".

Next, let's add a Typescript file to our project. Right-click on the project in Solution Explorer and select Add > New Item. From the dialog box, select TypeScript File and name it "app.ts".

Now let's write some code in our Typescript file:

class Greeter {
greeting: string;
constructor(message: string) {
this.greeting = message;
}
greet() {
return "Hello, " + this.greeting;
}
}
let greeter = new Greeter("world");
console.log(greeter.greet());

In order to use this Typescript code in our [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) MVC application, we'll need to compile it into JavaScript. To do this, we'll need to modify our project's build settings. Right-click on the project in Solution Explorer and select Properties. In the Properties dialog box, select TypeScript Build and set the "Compile on Save" option to true.

Now, every time you save your Typescript file, it will be automatically compiled into JavaScript. To include the compiled JavaScript file in your web page, you can use the following code:

<script src="~/Scripts/app.js"></script>

Conclusion

In this blog post, we've covered the basics of getting started with Typescript and [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) MVC. We've looked at installation and setup, writing Typescript code, compiling and running the code, and creating an [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) MVC application with Typescript. We hope this has been helpful in getting you

# GateOfMusicians
a musician site mvc5. I wrote this codes synchronusly with murat maseren courses. I change some codes to my like. it takes 1-2 week. I better understand the mvc5 technologie. you can see the site in enginkaratas.com. you can follow your chords with this site when you play music with any of music instrument. With that, you can make comment to music page. You can add new song to site. You have profile. you can change your profile

Are you thinking about developing a web application for musicians? In this blog post, we'll cover the basics of ASP.NET MVC CodeFirst Entity Framework and show you how to develop a web application for musicians. We'll discuss the different components of this web application and how they work together to provide a great user experience.

Understanding Entity Framework

Entity Framework is a tool that allows you to manage relational tables in a database by creating models in your programming language. It's also known as an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool. CodeFirst, a component of Entity Framework, allows you to create database tables by writing code using attributes.

Understanding MVC and ASP.NET

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, which is a design pattern that separates the application into three parts: the model, the view, and the controller. ASP.NET is a web framework that's used to build web applications and desktop applications. ASP.NET MVC is a web framework developed by Microsoft that adds the MVC layer to ASP.NET.

Understanding Layered Architecture

Layered architecture is a design pattern that provides several benefits, such as security, centralized management, and cross-platform compatibility. It's also useful when different user interfaces are added to the application, as they can share common layers of code. For our musician web application, we'll create six layers of code, including Login, GateOfMusicians, and 4 other custom layers.

CRUD Operations

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are methods used to manage data in a database. These methods will be used to manage the data for our musician web application.

Bootstrap

Bootstrap is an open-source front-end framework that contains design templates for HTML and CSS. It's useful for creating responsive web pages that can adjust to different screen sizes.

Development Process

To develop our musician web application, we'll use a layered architecture to make it easier to add new features as needed. We'll create classes and interfaces for each layer, such as Login, GateOfMusicians, and others. We'll also use TypeScript to make it easier to develop and debug the front-end code.

Getting Started with TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds features like static typing and classes to the language. It's a great choice for large web applications because it makes the code easier to read and debug. We'll use TypeScript to create classes and interfaces for our musician web application.

User Management

User management is a critical component of our musician web application. We'll create a login page where users can enter their credentials, and we'll store their information in a database. We'll also create a registration page where users can create a new account.

Gate of Musicians

The Gate of Musicians is the main page of our web application. We'll use Bootstrap to create a responsive layout that looks great on any device. The page will contain a list of musicians, and users can click on a musician to view their profile.

Musician Profile

The musician profile page will contain information about the musician, such as their biography, discography, and upcoming shows. Users can also leave comments and ratings on the musician's profile.

Adding a New Musician

Users can add new musicians to the database by filling out a form on the Gate of Musicians page. We'll use the Create method of CRUD to add the new musician to the database.

Migrations

Migrations are necessary when records that should not be deleted start to be created in the database. When a new column or similar information needs to be added, we cannot recreate our database from scratch. That's where migrations scenarios come in.

After uploading the release files to FTP and making sure that our database has the same name as the one we work on locally, the connection string must be set to connect to the database on the server. The steps to activate migrations, create a migration, and update the database are as follows:

To activate migrations, run the command enable-migrations in the data access layer.

Create a migration with the command add-migration migration_name.

Update the database with the command Update-Database.
